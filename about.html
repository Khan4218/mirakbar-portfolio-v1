    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
      <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Mir Akbar Ali Khan</strong>, a passionate front-end web developer with a background in
        Mechanical Engineering (BTech from JNTUH). While my degree is technical, my interest in building interactive web
        experiences led me to the world of web development.</p>

      <p>Over the past few months, I’ve immersed myself in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building projects like a YouTube
        Clone, a JavaScript learning series with real-time apps, and an Amazon-style eCommerce front-end clone. These
        projects helped me understand real-world UI logic, user interaction, DOM manipulation, and localStorage
        persistence.</p>

      <p>I’m continuously learning modern front-end techniques and tools, aiming to contribute to professional-level web
        applications. My goal is to become a full-stack developer in the near future.</p>

      <p>If you're looking for a dedicated and fast-learning developer, let's connect!</p>
